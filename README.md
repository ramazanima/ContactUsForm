I created this web application to help faciliate the TA process at the Computer Science Department at Berea College. This application will make the lab hour more efficient by asking the students to ask their questions prior to coming to the lab so that the Teaching Assistants have ample time to get ready for the questions and answer as efficiently as possible.
